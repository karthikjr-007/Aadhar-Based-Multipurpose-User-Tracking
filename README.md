A national identification system is basically a method utilized by the government to establish the identities of individuals in their society who necessarily transact with the government or avail of its services. The system has been adopted by other countries, each having a version of its own that is tailored-fit to accommodate their own socio-political circumstances. Proponents of the bill believe that the benefits of having such a system far outweigh the disadvantages. Advocates contend that with a National ID system in place, the government shall gain substantial headway in combating terrorism, illegal immigration, crime and tax fraud. At any rate, the success of the National ID System will only be ensured once it is demonstrated to the public that indeed the purpose for the implementation of the scheme is being served, that is; providing a streamlined, efficient and productive government service sans red tape, fixers and other negative notions associated with transacting business with the government.
